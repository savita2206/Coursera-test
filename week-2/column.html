		<p id="p1">When Lalitha started taking library classes, she noticed how Deepthi almost never talked in the class. She realized that Deepthi needed to learn the basics of the language so that she can start reading on her own. Thus, she started taking classes on phonetics, sight words and Deepthi started reading a few words which could be found repeatedly in books, on posters, on hoardings etc. This boosted her confidence which in turn made her pay even more attention in Lalithaâ€™s class. Soon, she was asking the pronunciation of new words and their meanings. She even raised her hand when Lalitha asked for volunteers for a story telling session. </p>
		<p id="p2">When the facilitators of ILP visited her school and explained various types of career opportunities, she realized that her goal could be reached by becoming a social worker. She asked various questions as to what subjects to take in her 11th and 12th class, which exam to prepare for after 12th class, the fees for the colleges and so on. She finally had a plan to act upon. The facilitators also explained the concept of scholarships that the students can get depending on certain conditions. Not only Nandini but many other students had no idea that their higher studies can be funded by external sources.</p>
