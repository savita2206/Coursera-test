		<h2>Case study 1</h2>
		<p>Deepthi V from ZPHS Lingampally could not read even 2-3 letter words in English. Since, she was in English medium school and all her text books were in English, she started losing interest&nbsp;in&nbsp;studies altogether. Thus, she would sit quietly in a corner and not respond to any queries of the teachers. </p>
		<p>When Lalitha started taking library classes, she noticed how Deepthi almost never talked in the class. She realized that Deepthi needed to learn the basics of the language so that she can start reading on her own. Thus, she started taking classes on phonetics, sight words and Deepthi started reading a few words which could be found repeatedly in books, on posters, on hoardings etc. This boosted her confidence which in turn made her pay even more attention in Lalitha’s class. Soon, she was asking the pronunciation of new words and their meanings. She even raised her hand when Lalitha asked for volunteers for a story telling session. </p>
		<p> In her own words, “No one taught me how to read words. When Lalitha ma’am taught phonetics, I tried reading the book ‘Pepper brushes his teeth’ and could read some words. I felt motivated to read more. Lalitha ma’am helped me a lot. She would ask me to try harder and in the next class we would discuss my progress. Library class became my favorite class.”</p>

		<h2>Case Study 2</h2>
		<p>K Nandini studying in ZPHS Sanath Nagar old knew only police, doctor and engineer as viable options for the future. However, she was not genuinely interested in any of these options, no matter how much emphasis the teachers and parents put on these choices. She knew she wanted to help people like her who did not have enough resources at their disposal to feed their families. She wanted to help the people of her community in improving their standard of living by making the school authorities responsible for better education and making opportunities available for everyone. However, she did not know how to proceed.</p>

		<h2>Testimonial 1</h2>
		<p>I attended the training sessions organized by ILP for the teachers and found the experiments really captivating. I was really impressed that the experiments were done with materials which are readily available around us. I discussed the utility of the kit with other teachers as well and we all knew that the kit can be used extensively to explain the science concepts to the students.</p>

		<h2>Testimonial 2</h2>
		<p>I am quite happy with the way ILP facilitator conducts the classes. I noticed that the procedure followed by ILP in library classes was different from other NGOs. The facilitator took periodic assessments due to which I had the progress report of every student right from the initial levels. After 2 months, I noticed a change in the vocabulary of the students and the atmosphere of the classes. The students seemed eager to read the books and knew which books to pick up. I can see that the framework followed by ILP is generating the desired results.
